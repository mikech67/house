    <td><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This simulation lets you experiment with house construction to see  how your insulation choices affect a home's energy consumption. You'll find  that proper insulation can dramatically reduce the amount of power needed to  keep a house comfortably warm in cold weather.</P>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Start by choosing the size of your house. There are red  circles on three of the house's corners and dragging those circles with the  mouse changes the house's length, width, and height. Once the house size is  set, adjust the house's window area by dragging the circles on  its  windows.</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Next, set the indoor and outdoor temperatures. You can enter  these values in either °C or °F. The colder the outdoor temperature and the  warmer the indoor temperature, the faster heat will flow out of the house through its walls, ceiling, and windows. You  can choose temperatures from -40 °C to +40 °C, although the indoor temperature  can't be less than the outdoor temperature.</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">With these basic settings complete, it's time to insulate  your house. Your insulation choices for the walls and ceilings are brick, wood,  fiberglass, and urethane foam. The thermal characteristics of those materials  are:</P>

      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">In addition to picking the type of insulation, you can  adjust its thickness. That thickness can range from 2 to 500 cm. Below 2 cm,  your house wouldn't have a real wall or ceiling. Above 500 cm, its insulation would  be impractically thick. The thicker the insulation and the smaller its thermal  conductivity, the less heat will flow through each square-meter of it. For  practical reasons, you can't use brick for the ceiling insulation.</P>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Windows are also surprisingly important when it comes to  keeping your house warm. You can't choose the thickness of your windows, but  you can choose their construction: single pane, double pane, Low-E double pane,  and Low-E argon-filled double pane. The thermal characteristics of those  windows are:</P>

      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As you assemble and insulate your house, watch how much flows through its walls, ceiling, and windows. With poor insulation, a surprising amount of thermal  power escapes from your house and your furnace or woodstove will have to supply that  amount of thermal power to keep your house at the indoor temperature you  selected.</P>
    Make adjustments to your house size or insulation, or  change the  indoor or outdoor temperatures. With reasonable insulating choices, you'll find  that you can make an enormous difference in the amount of power needed to heat  your home. You can also make surprisingly bad choices, so be glad that you're  only working on with simulation.    </p>    </td>
